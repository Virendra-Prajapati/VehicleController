# UNITY VEHICLE CONTROLLER WITH AI CONTROL

## SUMMARY

THIS UNITY-BASED VEHICLE CONTROLLER SCRIPT UTILIZES UNITY'S PHYSICS ENGINE TO SIMULATE REALISTIC VEHICLE DYNAMICS, OFFERING A VERSATILE SOLUTION FOR RACING GAMES, DRIVING SIMULATORS, OR ANY GAME THAT REQUIRES VEHICLE MOVEMENT. THE CONTROLLER SUPPORTS BOTH **PLAYER** AND **AI** VEHICLE CONTROL, WITH ADVANCED FEATURES LIKE DRIFTING, BOOSTING, REALISTIC STEERING, DECELERATION, OBSTACLE DETECTION, AND WAYPOINT-BASED NAVIGATION.

## KEY FEATURES

- **ADVANCED DRIFTING & BOOSTING**: DRIFT YOUR CAR THROUGH CORNERS AND BOOST YOUR SPEED FOR AN ADRENALINE-FUELED RACING EXPERIENCE.
- **REALISTIC STEERING & DECELERATION**: ACHIEVE SMOOTH AND RESPONSIVE VEHICLE CONTROL WITH REAL-WORLD PHYSICS.
- **AI CONTROL WITH OBSTACLE DETECTION & AVOIDANCE**: AI VEHICLES CAN DETECT OBSTACLES IN THEIR PATH AND ADJUST THEIR MOVEMENT ACCORDINGLY, ENSURING DYNAMIC AND INTELLIGENT BEHAVIOR ON THE TRACK.
- **AI NAVIGATION VIA WAYPOINTS**: AI-CONTROLLED VEHICLES FOLLOW WAYPOINTS, NAVIGATING THE TRACK SMOOTHLY AND WITH DECISION-MAKING ABILITY TO AVOID OBSTACLES.
- **PLAYER CONTROL VIA UNITY INPUT SYSTEM**: FULLY SUPPORTS UNITY’S DEFAULT INPUT SYSTEM, OFFERING RESPONSIVE CONTROL OVER YOUR VEHICLE.

## FEATURES

- **WHEEL COLLIDER-BASED VEHICLE PHYSICS**: ACCURATE VEHICLE DYNAMICS USING UNITY'S BUILT-IN WHEEL COLLIDERS.
- **DRIFTING AND BOOSTING MECHANICS**: CONTROL THE CAR'S DRIFT BEHAVIOR AND APPLY SPEED BOOSTS DURING GAMEPLAY.
- **AI-CONTROLLED VEHICLES WITH OBSTACLE DETECTION & AVOIDANCE**: AI VEHICLES INTELLIGENTLY NAVIGATE THE ENVIRONMENT, DETECTING AND AVOIDING OBSTACLES IN THEIR PATH, MAKING THE RACE MORE DYNAMIC AND UNPREDICTABLE.
- **AI WAYPOINTS & REVERSE HANDLING**: AI-CONTROLLED VEHICLES FOLLOW WAYPOINTS, WITH THE ABILITY TO REVERSE IF STUCK, AVOID OBSTACLES, AND REORIENT THEMSELVES DYNAMICALLY.
- **PLAYER INPUT VIA UNITY INPUT SYSTEM**: SEAMLESSLY INTEGRATE WITH UNITY’S DEFAULT INPUT SYSTEM FOR RESPONSIVE PLAYER CONTROL.

## INSTALLATION

1. **CLONE OR DOWNLOAD THE REPOSITORY**.
2. **IMPORT THE SCRIPT, VEHICLE MODELS, AND ASSETS** INTO YOUR UNITY PROJECT.
3. **SET UP THE VEHICLE GAMEOBJECT** WITH WHEEL COLLIDERS AND ATTACH THE VEHICLE CONTROLLER SCRIPT.
4. **ATTACH THE AICONTROL SCRIPT TO THE AI VEHICLE** AND LINK THE SPLINECOMPUTER (TRACK PATH) AND OTHER NECESSARY REFERENCES IN THE INSPECTOR.
5. **CONFIGURE THE AI WAYPOINTS, OBSTACLE LAYERS, AND SENSOR DISTANCES** AS NEEDED FOR YOUR SCENE.
6. **SET UP THE VEHICLE MODELS AND ENVIRONMENT TO MATCH YOUR SCENE**.

## CONFIGURATION

THE **VEHICLECONTROLLER** AND **AICONTROL** SCRIPTS COME WITH A VARIETY OF CUSTOMIZABLE PARAMETERS TO SUIT DIFFERENT TYPES OF VEHICLES AND GAMEPLAY STYLES. HERE ARE SOME OF THE KEY CONFIGURATION OPTIONS:

### VEHICLE CONTROLLER CONFIGURATION
- **MAX SPEED** (`maxSpeed`): THE TOP SPEED THE VEHICLE CAN REACH (IN UNITS PER SECOND).
- **ACCELERATION** (`acceleration`): HOW QUICKLY THE VEHICLE ACCELERATES TO ITS MAX SPEED.
- **DECELERATION** (`deceleration`): HOW QUICKLY THE VEHICLE SLOWS DOWN WHEN THE THROTTLE IS RELEASED OR WHEN BRAKING IS APPLIED.
- **STEERING SENSITIVITY** (`steeringSensitivity`): ADJUSTS HOW SENSITIVE THE STEERING IS WHEN TURNING.
- **TRACTION CONTROL** (`tractionControl`): A MULTIPLIER AFFECTING THE GRIP OF THE VEHICLE’S TIRES.

### AI CONTROL CONFIGURATION
- **TARGET LAYER** (`targetLayer`): DEFINES THE LAYERS THAT THE AI WILL DETECT FOR OBSTACLES (E.G., WALLS, OTHER CARS).
- **SENSOR LENGTH** (`sensorLength`): DETERMINES HOW FAR THE AI CAN "SEE" WHEN SCANNING FOR OBSTACLES.
- **SIDE SENSOR DISTANCE** (`sideSensorDistance`): HOW FAR THE SIDE SENSORS EXTEND FROM THE AI VEHICLE FOR COLLISION DETECTION.
- **SIDE SENSOR ANGLE** (`sideSensorAngle`): THE ANGLE AT WHICH SIDE SENSORS SCAN FOR OBSTACLES.
- **SENSOR CENTER OFFSET** (`sensorCenterOffset`): OFFSET FROM THE CENTER OF THE VEHICLE WHERE THE FRONT AND SIDE SENSORS ARE LOCATED.

### ADDITIONAL SETTINGS
- **WAYPOINT RADIUS** (`waypointRadius`): THE RADIUS AROUND A WAYPOINT WITHIN WHICH THE AI WILL START TURNING TOWARDS THE NEXT WAYPOINT.
- **AI MAX SPEED** (`aiMaxSpeed`): THE TOP SPEED OF AI-CONTROLLED VEHICLES.
- **OBSTACLE DETECTION RANGE** (`obstacleDetectionRange`): THE RANGE AT WHICH THE AI WILL DETECT AND REACT TO OBSTACLES.
- **OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE SENSITIVITY** (`obstacleAvoidanceSensitivity`): HOW SENSITIVE THE AI IS TO DETECTED OBSTACLES.

## EXAMPLE SETUP

### TO SET UP THE AI CONTROL WITH WAYPOINTS AND OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE:

1. **ASSIGN THE AICONTROL SCRIPT**: ATTACH THE AICONTROL SCRIPT TO THE AI-CONTROLLED VEHICLE.
2. **CONNECT THE SPLINECOMPUTER**: IN THE INSPECTOR, LINK THE SPLINECOMPUTER COMPONENT THAT DEFINES THE RACE TRACK PATH.
3. **ADJUST SENSOR SETTINGS**: FINE-TUNE THE SENSOR LENGTH, DISTANCE, AND ANGLE TO MAKE THE AI REACT APPROPRIATELY TO OBSTACLES IN YOUR SCENE.
4. **CONFIGURE AI WAYPOINTS**: SET UP A SERIES OF WAYPOINTS ALONG THE TRACK FOR THE AI TO FOLLOW.

FEEL FREE TO CUSTOMIZE AND EXPAND THE VEHICLE CONTROLLER FOR YOUR OWN UNITY PROJECTS. WHETHER YOU'RE BUILDING A RACING GAME, A DRIVING SIMULATOR, OR JUST TESTING VEHICLE DYNAMICS, THIS CONTROLLER PROVIDES A ROBUST SOLUTION WITH BOTH PLAYER AND AI VEHICLE SUPPORT.
